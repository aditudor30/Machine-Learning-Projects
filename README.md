# Machine-Learning-Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains my machine learning projects in which i used different algorithms, techniques and demonstrated real-world applications. Even though this repository is work in progress, each of my projects are organized in its own folder with the associated code, data and documentation.

## Overview
This repository serves as a portofolio of machine learning projects on subjects including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning and natural language processing. Each project consist of:
  - A thourough notebook outlining the problem, how I approach it and the results.
  - Datasets or links to the sources of the datasets.
  - Scripts for training and model evaluation.
  - Results visualizations.
## Projects
1.  Linear Regression on Student Performance

     - **Description**: A simple regression model to predict student performance based on features like hours of studying, hours slept and previous scores.
     - **Techniques**: Linear Regression, One-Hot Encoding, Residual Graphing.
     - **Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`.
       
2. Logistic Regression on Diagnosing Breast Cancer
     - **Description**: A simple regression model to predict if cells are benign or malignant based on certain scientific data.
     - **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Handling Missing and Redundant Data, Encoding Categorical Data.
     - **Libraries**: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`.
3. K-Means Clustering on FIFA 22 Men's Data Set
     - **Description**: An implementation from scratch of the K-Means algorithm to see patterns between certain stats of footballers such as age, rating, potential, wage.
     - **Techniques**: K-Means Clustering, Data Normalization with Min-Max Scaling, Manual Algorithm Implementation, PCA for Diamensionality Reduction and Visualization.
     - **Libraries**: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, `IPython`.
   
## Project Structure
Each project typically follows this structure:

  ```
  project-name/
  │
  ├── data/               # Dataset used for the project (if applicable)
  ├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations
  ├── scripts/            # Python scripts for training and evaluation
  ├── models/             # Saved models (if applicable)
  ├── README.md           # Detailed description and instructions for this project
  └── requirements.txt    # Project-specific dependencies (optional)
  ```
## Conclusion
Thanks for checking out the Machine Learning Projects Repository! As an intermediate practitioner, I've found that working on these projects has deepened my understanding of various machine learning concepts and techniques. I hope you find these examples helpful in your own journey, whether you're looking to enhance your skills or explore new ideas.

Feel free to experiment with the code, adapt the projects to your own datasets, or contribute with your insights. If you have any questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out.
